    Assignment 4: Position-based Dynamics
</h1>

<p class="mb-4">
    Welcome to our exploration of physics-based simulation! In this assignment, you will learn the XPBD (Extended Position-Based Dynamics) simulation algorithm and implement a physics simulator in a GLSL shader. This assignment focuses on simulating particles using distance, collision, and ground constraints. By the end of this assignment, you will have a working simulation that visualizes particle interactions in real time. Let’s dive in!

</p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Requirements</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
    In this assignment, you will implement three types of constraints: spring between particles, particle-particle collisions and particle-ground collisions. You will implement the constraint function, gradient of constraint, and core calculations for XPBD simulation for each constraint. You will also use the XPBD solver to simulate all elements on the screen. We will briefly discuss each step as follows. The comments in <code class="code-inline">fragment.glsl</code> will also guide you through the implementation of each step.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 1: Springs</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    The physical system is consisted of particles connected by springs. In step 1, you will implement the springs connecting particles. There are some springs that will be created by the starter code at the beginning. Besides, if you push down left mouse button on the canvas, it will enable a dedicated particle 0 at that location and connect it to the closest existing particle with a dedicated spring 0. This allows you to interactively drag the particles on the screen.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 1.1: Spring Constraint</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Implement the positional constraint for elastic springs in <code class="code-inline">spring_constraint()</code>:
    \[ \epsilon_{\text{spring}} = \underbrace{\| \mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b \|}_{\text{current length}} - \underbrace{L_0}_{{\text{rest length}}} \]
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 1.2: Spring Constraint Gradient</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Implement the constraint Jacobian in <code class="code-inline">spring_constraint_gradient()</code>:
    \[ \nabla\epsilon_{\text{spring}} = \frac{\mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b}{\|\mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b\|} \]
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> Handle singularity for \( \|\mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b\| = 0 \) by returning \((0,0).\)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 1.3: Solve for Springs with XPBD</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Solve the constrained optimization problem in <code class="code-inline">solve_spring()</code>:
    \[ \lambda = \frac{-\epsilon_{\text{spring}}}{\underbrace{\sum m^{-1}\|∇\epsilon_\text{spring}\|^2}_{\text{inertial term}} + \underbrace{\alpha/\Delta t^2}_{{\text{compliance term}}}} \]
    <ul>
        <li>\( m \) = particle mass (\( m^{-1} \) stored in <code>inv_mass</code>)</li>
        <li>You do not need to calculate the compliance term since it's provided in the code.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 2: Particle-Particle Collision</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    In this step, we will create collision constraints between all pairs of particles. Note that particle 0 is dedicated for mouse, therefore it will not be involved in collision constraints with other particles. The collision constraints will ensure that particles do not overlap with each other. This is achieved by implementing a positional constraint that pushes particles apart when they are too close.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 2.1: Collision Constraint</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Implement <code class="code-inline">collision_constraint()</code>:
    \[ \epsilon_{\text{coll}} = \begin{cases} 
    \| \mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b \| - d_{\text{min}} & \text{if } \|\mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b\| < d_{\text{min}} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \]
    <ul>
        <li>It's equivalent to adding a spring when two particles are close enough.</li>
        <li>\( d_{\text{min}} = 0.2 \) is given by the parameter collision_dist </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 2.2: Collision Constraint Gradient</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Compute contact normal vector in <code class="code-inline">collision_constraint_gradient()</code>:
    \[ \nabla\epsilon_{\text{coll}} = \begin{cases}
    \frac{\mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b}{\|\mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b\|} & \|\mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b\| < d_{\text{min}} \\
    \mathbf{0} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \]
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 2.3: Solve for Collisions with XPBD</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Implement the collision solver in <code class="code-inline">solve_collision_constraint()</code> using XPBD:
    \[ \lambda = \frac{-\epsilon_{\text{coll}}}{\underbrace{\sum m^{-1}\|∇\epsilon_\text{coll}\|^2}_{\text{inertial term}} + \underbrace{\alpha/\Delta t^2}_{{\text{compliance term}}}} \]
    <ul>
        <li>Similar to the spring solver, but now using the collision constraint.</li>
        <li>You again don't need to calculate the compliance term since it's already provided.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 3: Particle-Ground Collision</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    In this step, we will create a ground constraint to prevent particles from penetrating the ground surface. This is achieved by implementing a positional constraint that pushes particles up when they are below a certain threshold distance from the ground. The ground is defined by a sdf function phi(p)=0 where p=(x,y).
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 3.1: Ground Constraint</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Implement ground constraint in <code class="code-inline">ground_constraint()</code> to prevent particles from penetrating the ground surface.

    The ground constraint is defined as:
    \[
    \epsilon_{\text{ground}}(p) =
    \begin{cases}
    \phi(p) - d_{\text{ground}}, & \text{if } \phi(p) < d_{\text{ground}} \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
    where \( \phi(p) \) represents the signed distance function (SDF) of the ground, and \( d_{\text{ground}} \) is the threshold distance for collision detection. It is given by the parameter ground_collision_dist.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 3.2: Compute Ground Constraint Gradient</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Implement <code class="code-inline">ground_constraint_gradient()</code> to compute the gradient of the ground constraint, which is necessary for applying position corrections.
    
    <p>The constraint gradient is given by:</p>
    \[
    \nabla \epsilon_{\text{ground}} =
    \begin{cases}
    \nabla \phi(p), & \text{if } \phi(p) < d_{\text{ground}} \\
    (0,0), & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
    
    <p>Since the signed distance function (SDF) of the ground is defined as:</p>
    \[
    \phi(p) = p_y - (0.1 \sin(2\pi p_x) - 0.5),
    \]
    its gradient is computed as:
    \[
    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial p_x} = -0.1 \cdot 2\pi \cos(2\pi p_x), \quad
    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial p_y} = 1.0.
    \]
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 3.3: Solve for Ground Constraints with XPBD</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Implement the ground constraint solver in <code class="code-inline">solve_ground_constraint()</code> using XPBD:
    
    \[
    \lambda = \frac{-\epsilon_{\text{ground}}}{\underbrace{m^{-1} \|\nabla\epsilon_{\text{ground}}\|^2}_{\text{inertial term}} + \underbrace{\alpha/\Delta t^2}_{{\text{compliance term}}}}
    \]
    
    You still don't need to calculate the compliance term since it's provided in the code.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 4: Solve All Constraints</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    In this step, you will implement the full constraint solver in <code class="code-inline">solve_constraints()</code>using previously defined functions:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring constraints:</strong> Solve all spring constraints defined in <code class="code-inline">springs[1]</code> to <code class="code-inline">springs[n_springs - 1]</code> using <code class="code-inline">solve_spring()</code>. Spring 0 is a specific spring that is only active when left mouse button is pressed down. The starter code has already taken care of it.</li>
        <li><strong>Ground constraints:</strong> Solve for all particles (except the mouse-controlled particle \( 0 \)) using <code class="code-inline">solve_ground_constraint()</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Collision constraints:</strong> Solve pairwise collisions for all particles (except the mouse-controlled particle \( 0 \)) using <code class="code-inline">solve_collision_constraint()</code>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Once you implemented all steps, you should simulate the particle system similar to the video shown below:</p>

<video controls autoplay loop muted style="max-width: 75%; height: auto;">
    <source src="/assignments/A4-ref.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    A4 Reference Video
</video>
