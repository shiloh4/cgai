    Assignment 3: Gaussian Splatting
</h1>

<p class="mb-4">
    Welcome to our exploration of Gaussian Splatting! In this assignment, we'll be optimizing for 2D Gaussians to represent images, while building up the intuition that generalizes to 3D Gaussian Splatting.
    In Part 1, we'll be targeting a "synthetic" image (originally reconstructed from Gaussians). In Part 2, we'll be optimizing for an actual target image. The main part of this project will be in Python using a Colab Jupyter Notebook. 
    Then, you will fill in our implementation of a Gaussian GLSL shader and export your optimized parameters into it for visualization. Let's get started!

<h2 class="h2-custom">Requirements</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
    For this assignment, you are expected to optimize two components to reconstruct both a "synthetic" and a real target image: <em>create 2D gaussians</em>, <em>optimize gaussians on a "synthetic" image</em>, <em>optimize gaussians on an image of your choice</em>, and <em>render optimized gaussians</em>. 
    We will briefly discuss each step as follows, but more information and equation explanations can be found in the Jupyter notebook file <code class="code-inline">2DGS_A3_solution.ipynb</code>, along with your starter code.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 0: Create 2D Gaussians</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    You are tasked to write some of the necessary building blocks for creating the 2D gaussian representation required for gaussian splatting. 
    This includes the inverse covariance matrix of the Gaussian and the accumulation of Gaussians across an image, which will help us evaluate 
    and visualize how well our Gaussian "splats" can represent our target image.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 0.1: Build The Inverse Covariance Matrix</h3>

<p>A 2D Gaussian is parameterized by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>centers <b>c = [c_x,  c_y ]<sup>T</sup></b></li>
        <li>scales <b> &sigma; = [&sigma;_x,  &sigma;_y ]<sup>T</sup></b></li>
        <li>scalar rotation <b>&theta;</b> (Note: We could also use a unit-length complex number in the spirit of using quaternions in 3D, but a scalar rotation is perfectly fine.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Its value at point <b>p</b> is given by</p>

    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A3_img/a3_eq1.png" alt="Explanation of 2D gaussian's value at specific point p">
    </div>

    <p>where the covariance matrix <b>&Sigma;</b> describes the shape of the Gaussian, and we build it as</p>

    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A3_img/a3_eq2.png" alt="Explanation of 2D gaussian's covariance matrix creation">
    </div>

    <p>making use of (1) <b>(AB)<sup>-1</sup> = B<sup>-1</sup> A<sup>-1</sup>, and (2) R<sup>-1</sup> = R<sup>T</sup></b> for rotational matrices, we have</p>

    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A3_img/a3_eq3.png" alt="Explanation of 2D gaussian's inverse covariance matrix creation">
    </div>

    <br>

    <p>If we want to write out our 2D Gaussian function explicitly, we have:</p>

    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A3_img/a3_eq4.png" alt="Equation representing 2D Gaussian function">
    </div>

    <p>where</p>

    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A3_img/a3_eq5.png" alt="Expanded Equation of 2D gaussian's inverse covariance matrix creation">
    </div>

</br>

<p class="mb-4">    
    Here, you will build the inverse covariance matrix for a single 2D Gaussian, using the provided rotation and scale vector. 
    In order to do this, you must build the rotation matrix R and the diagonal inverse scaling matrix D (seen above as (SS^T)).
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 0.2: Accumulate contribution of Gaussians for image field</h3>

<p>
    To reconstruct a 2D image, we add together functions of this form, but also multiply them by an "alpha" channel.
    In the original 3DGS implementation, they use a Gaussian-wise <b>(&alpha; &isin; &#8477;)</b> and RGB color 
    <b>[c<sub>r</sub>, c<sub>g</sub>, c<sub>b</sub>] &isin; &#8477;<sup>3</sup> </b> (converted from spherical harmonics in 3D, given our current view direction).
</p>

<br>
<p>
    To simplify things here, we multiply these together, and store 
    <b> &alpha; </b> = &alpha; &sdot; [c<sub>r</sub>, c<sub>g</sub>, c<sub>b</sub>] for each Gaussian.
</p>

<p>
    Thus, we reconstruct each pixel <b>p</b> of our 2D image <b>I</b> by summing together contributions from <b>N</b> Gaussians as
</p>

<div class="image-container2">
    <img src="/assignments/A3_img/a3_eq6.png" alt="Explanation of accumulation of Gaussian Contribution across image">
</div>

</br>

<p class="mb-4">    
    Here, you will reconstruct the image by sampling multiple 2D Gaussians over a given 2D domain.
    In order to do this for each gaussian, you must apply the inverse covariance matrix to the Gaussian's position to get the transformed position and apply the function f(p) to the transformed position as seen in the equation block above. 
    Finally, you must multiply the alpha of the gaussian by the gaussian's contribution value f(p) to get the weighted contribution of this Gaussian that can be added to the image field.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 1: Optimize for Synthetic Ground Truth</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    In Steps 1.1 and 1.2, we show how to create a "synthetic" or program-based set of Gaussians to represent an image. 
    We then ask you to help build the optimization loop for training our Gaussian representation in Step 1.3. 
    This implementation builds off of the optimization work you have done in our previous projects.

</br>
</br>
    
    Finally, in Step 1.4, you are tasked to create your own unique and creative synthetic target image based on the simplistic synthetic image we have provided. Feel free to change the number of Gaussians, 
    just make sure to have the same number of colors, positions, scales, and rotations defined in each tensor (i.e. match their first dimension). <b>REMEMBER to answer the reflection question 
    at the end of section 1.2 about the initial gaussian image pre-optimization! </b> 

</br>
</br>

    Once you have implemented this step, you should be able to observe the optimization process for the "synthetic" image as shown in the video below. 
</p>

    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 2: Optimize for Target Image</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Here, we complete the same process as in Step 1, but customized for a target image of our choosing. 
    We begin by loading the target image (Ours is the Mona Lisa) in Step 2.1 and initializing a set of random Gaussians in Step 2.2 to optimize for the target image.
</br>

</br>
Hint: When using colab, create a folder named <code>data</code> and upload your target image into it.
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="/assignments/A3_img/monalisaSetup.png" alt="Picture of colab setup of data folder">
</div>

</br>

</br>
    You are asked to once again use your knowledge of optimization and loss functions from prior projects to fill in the gaps within the gaussian splatting optimization process in Step 2.3. 
    You will initialize the learning rate, optimizer, and loss function in Step 2.3.1 and implement the optimization loop in Step 2.3.2. 
    Additionally, as part of our creative expression section, after you test with our sample image (The Mona Lisa), 
    add your own target image in Step 2.1 and optimize a new set of gaussians for your chosen target image. 
    The optimal count of gaussians for our shader is 100-200 gaussians so avoid setting a super large number of Gaussians.
    <b>REMEMBER to save your optimization videos/images to turn in with your code! </b> 

</br>
</br>
    The final section of Step 2 (Step 2.4) is to run the exporting code to export your final Gaussian parameters into a GLSL format so we can run your Gaussian optimization in the GLSL shader.
</br>
</br>

    Once you have implemented this step, you should be able to observe the optimization process for the provided target image as shown in the video below. 
</p>

<video controls autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="/assignments/A3_img/anim-image.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 3: Render Optimized Gaussians</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    In this step, you must copy your generated Gaussian parameters for the target image and fill in the gaps in the <code class="code-inline">fragment.glsl</code> file to accurately show the list of gaussians. 
    You will essentially be implementing the same methods as in Step 0 so make sure to refer to the equations above for support and clarity.  This way, you can see your target gaussian splatting image on the class website.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 3.1: Import your Gaussian Parameters</h3>

<p class="mb-4">    
    Copy and paste the gaussian parameters that you generated in the Jupyter notebook into the specified area in the GLSL shader, similar to in previous projects.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 3.2: Build The GLSL Inverse Covariance Matrix (<code>buildSigmaInv</code>)</h3>

<p class="mb-4">    
    Like in Step 0.1, you will build the inverse covariance matrix for a single 2D Gaussian, using the provided rotation and scale vector. 
    In order to do this, you must build the rotation matrix R and the diagonal inverse scaling matrix D (seen in the equations as (SS^T)).
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 3.3: Accumulate contribution of Gaussians for image field</h3>

<p class="mb-4">    
    Like in Step 0.2, you will reconstruct the image by sampling multiple 2D Gaussians over a given 2D domain.
    In order to do this for each gaussian, you must apply the inverse covariance matrix to the Gaussian's position to get the transformed position and apply the function f(p) to the transformed position as seen in the equation block above. 
    Finally, you must multiply the alpha of the gaussian by the gaussian's contribution value f(p) to get the weighted contribution of this Gaussian that can be added to the image field.
</p>
    
<br>
Once you finish implementation of Step 1 - 2.3 with the Mona Lisa image, you should see the looping animation shown below:

<h4 class="h4-custom">TA suggestion</h4>
<p class="mb-4">    
    You might want to implement 3.2 and 3.3 first before copying your Mona Lisa Gaussian parameters from the Jupyter notebook to the GLSL shader. When you use the default parameters provided in the shader, you should see a looping animation below.
